## Technical Background

My programming experience essentially consists of the coursework I've completed at GVSU. That being said, I'm proficient with Python as well as a little bit of C++, Bash and Linux. In terms of more general concepts, I'm familiar with some fundamental data structures and algorithms. Currently, I'm learning about fundamental software engineering concepts and processes, and I will be learning C in a couple weeks.
